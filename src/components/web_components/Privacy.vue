                    Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3)
                    nonprofit biomedical research organization in the United States, 
                    created to enhance how researchers approach the complexity of human
                    biological information and the treatment of disease.

                    <br>

                    We have developed a mobile application (the “Parkinson mPower App”)
                    to facilitate our Parkinson mPower research study (the “Study”).
                    The Study is designed to help Sage Bionetworks and research partners
                    understand variations in symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. 
                    The Study and the Parkinson mPower App are designed for users over
                    18 years of age, and are open for use or participation by anyone
                    , whether or not he or she has Parkinson’s disease.
                    <br>

                    personal data. “Personal data” means any information relating to an

                    <strong> Data Imports </strong>
                    <br>
                    The Parkinson mPower App allows you to import data to the Parkinson mPower App and the Study, 
                    including voice recordings and data collected in connection
                     with your performance of specified tasks while holding your
                    iPhone like walking and tapping or through sensors on your
                    iPhone. You may also give permission to import certain
                    data from third party wearable activity devices (like
                    Fitbit or Jawbone), as well as other data that you may
                    have provided to Apple Health app separately or that may be
                    available through other third party applications and data available
                    through Health app, such as birthdate, weight, height, steps
                    walked or sleep pattern. We are not responsible for the data
                    practices of third parties from which you may elect to import
                    data and you are advised to consult their privacy policies
                    separately. You may choose not to import these data types and to
                    still participate in the Study.

                    <strong> Health Surveys </strong>
                    <br>
                    With your permission, we collect and process some personal data that
                    is necessary for the purpose of the study. To better understand 
                    your evolving health, we will ask you to answer questions about
                    yourself (e.g., body height, weight, gender, age), your medical
                    history, and your current health, race or ethnicity. Most surveys 
                    are optional. You can skip any optional survey questions that 
                    you do not wish to answer. The diagnosis and medications survey is mandatory. It is used to appropriately administer activities to participants with or without Parkinson disease.

                    <br>
                    We automatically collect standard server log information, such as
                    internet protocol address and details of how you used the Parkinson
                    mPower App (e.g. history of page requests such as uploading data or 
                    signing in and date/time of request).

                    <br>
                    You may elect to turn on the location services on the mPower App 
                    and grant the app access to your GPS coordinates. With your permission, we use that location data to determine the overall distances you travelled so that we better understand your level of activity and evolving health, but we do not share your actual location.

                To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.

                As described above in the “How We Use Information” section, we will combine your Study data, including survey response and tasks measurements, with those of other Study participants. The combined data will be transferred to Synapse, a computational research platform, for analysis. Researchers from the Study team and its partners accessing data through Synapse will analyze the data and report findings back through blog or scientific publications. This Study gives you the option to share your coded Study data more broadly, with other researchers worldwide, for use in this research and beyond to benefit future scientific research. If you choose to share your data broadly, your coded data (without your contact information) will be added to a shared Study dataset on Synapse and will be made available to qualified researchers who are registered Synapse users and who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.

                    We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. In the event that any changes to this privacy policy materially alter your rights or obligations under this privacy policy, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Parkinson mPower App or the Study for the first time after such material changes are made. Your continued use of the Parkinson mPower App or the Study after the revised privacy policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the then-current version of this privacy policy.
