                        <strong>What is "mPower"?</strong>
                        <br> mPower is an iPhone app-based study designed to monitor and understand the causes of variations in symptoms of Parkinson disease (ParkinsonmPower.org). Living with Parkinson disease means coping with symptoms that change daily. Yet these daily changes are not tracked frequently enough. The Parkinson mPower app will use questionnaires, sensor data from your phone, and optional wearable device data to help you track your condition 24x7, allowing you to review trends and share this information with researchers.

                        <strong>Who is eligible to participate in mPower?</strong>
                        <br> Anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the US and has a personal iPhone is eligible to take part in the mPower research study in the US. Sage is working to broaden the scope of mPower to individuals in other countries.

                        <strong> I don’t have Parkinson disease. Can I participate in mPower? </strong>
                        <br> Yes! Participation from volunteers who do not have Parkinson disease will enable researchers to compile greatly needed, age-matched control data.

                        <br> This study is unique in that it gives you the choice of how to share your data. You can elect to share your coded study data (without your name or directly identifying information) with the study team and research partners only, or to share more broadly with other qualified researchers worldwide who registered with Synapse, Sage’s research platform. You can set your data sharing options during the enrollment process within the app and/or anytime thereafter on the app settings.
